# ![r](raccoon.png) Welcome to the Raccoon Engine!

This project is a full-featured retro-style 3D engine inspired by DOOM, including an intuitive sector-based editor that lets you build worlds with customizable wall heights, floors, ceilings, and more - just like the classics. It uses a Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) tree to efficiently sort polygons for correct rendering order. The engine supports directional sprites and textured walls, allowing you to create complex elements like fences and detailed environments. Built entirely in Python with native scripting, it seamlessly integrates any Python library for AI, procedural generation, or advanced gameplay logic. To maintain performance on a classic 320x240 resolution canvas (a nod to DOOM's original), it implements a front-to-back rendering approach combined with an efficient NumPy-based pixel masking technique that avoids unnecessary overdrawing. Additionally, radius-based culling limits rendering distance, ensuring smooth performance even on complex maps. The engine leverages Pygame for rendering and uses minimal dependencies for speed and simplicity, making it an accessible and extensible platform for retro 3D game development and experimentation. Head over to docs where I explain everything more in detail!

For now, let me show you a demo!
