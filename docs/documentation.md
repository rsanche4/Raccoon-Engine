A quick intro to the key math concepts you‚Äôll need to understand the engine (e.g., vectors, angles, coordinate systems).

### 8. Core Concepts Explained
In-depth explanation of important concepts like:

- Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)
- Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)
- 2.5D Projection and Raycasting

### 9. Rendering Pipeline
A breakdown of how the engine renders a frame: from raycasting to screen drawing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building and Customizing

### 10. Editor Usage Guide
How to use the built-in map editor, and how to export and place maps into the game directory.

Overview of the `.json` map format used by the engine.

### 12. Textures & Skyboxes
How to import and use textures. Setting up dynamic or static skyboxes. Pictures.

### 13. Sprites
Adding characters, objects, and effects with sprite support.

### 14. Collision Handling
How collisions work in the engine and how to define them in your maps.

## üß† Game Logic and Scripting

### 15. Scripting Your Game
Writing scripts to control gameplay logic, events, and game flow.

### 16. API Reference
Available API calls for interacting with the engine programmatically. Music use etc.

### 17. The `config.cfg` File
How to customize global settings and preferences.

### 18. Control Scheme

## üéÆ Gameplay and Distribution

### 19. Running Your Game
How to launch your game: simply run `python game.py`.

### 20. Bundling Your Game
How to turn your project into a standalone executable for Windows. (Includes links for Mac/Linux alternatives.)

### 21. Check out the Demo!
Right now there is a demo already written in the files! It is not much, as it is just our mascot Raccoony patrolling around a big city. Fun!

## üöß Limitations

### 22. Known Limitations and Constraints
Let's talk finally on the limitations behind the engine. From resolution to all the limits that we have and why they are there.
